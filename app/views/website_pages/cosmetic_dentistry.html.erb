                                <h4 class="margin-top">Porcelain Veneers</h4>
                                    Dental veneers (sometimes called porcelain veneers or dental porcelain laminates) are wafer-thin, custom-made shells of tooth-colored materials designed to cover the front surface of teeth to improve your appearance. These shells are bonded to the front of the teeth changing their color, shape, size, or length.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Dental veneers can be made from porcelain or from resin composite materials. Porcelain veneers resist stains better than resin veneers and better mimic the light reflecting properties of natural teeth. Resin veneers are thinner and require removal of less of the tooth surface before placement. You will need to discuss the best choice of veneer material for you with your dentist.

                                <h4>Teeth Whitening</h4>
                                    Many teeth whitening systems and products are available, including whitening toothpastes,  strips, trays, and whitening products obtained from our dentist.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Teeth whitening is ideal for people who have healthy, unrestored teeth (no fillings) and gums. Individuals with yellow tones to their teeth respond best to our treatment. But this cosmetic procedure is not recommended for everyone.

                            Call or send an e mail to the location that is convenient for you. You can fill out the contact form on line and someone will contact you to schedule an appointment by the next business day or the time you specify.
                        <h5 class="text bold margin-top margin-bottom">Why should I take care of my dental health</h5>
                            My program is proven. It has worked for me and many other patients. It is based on scientifically proven methods and the latest medical information from obesity research. I am a Family physician who is a member of the ASBP (*link to ASBP.org*). I follow the Bariatric guidelines and attend regularly sponsored activities by the ASBP. Your weight loss is supervised by a qualified physician who can assess all your medical issues.
                        <h5 class="text bold margin-top margin-bottom">Do I need to pay for my treatment all at once?</h5>
                            Yes. In fact, I encourage it. I will see you as a weight loss specialist. I function as a consult like a cardiologist, etc. I will address issues you may have that relate to obesity and its co-morbidities. You need to see your regular physician for your routine health maintenance and management of other chronic illnesses for which you are being treated. I will communicate with your referring physician regularly so they know what recommendations and medications I recommend.
